        'The Living Rosary Apostolate is a devotion that has become a worlwide call to prayer. It is the Rosary in its entirety, but it is a shared devotion and accessible to all even in the busy schedule of our modern society. You do not need to meet with a group of people, you can pray individually as an adult or young person anytime of the day or night at your own convenience. However if you desire, it can be prayed together as a husband and wife, or as a family with your children, or teachers with their student’s in our Catholic schools & CCD classes, it’s a wonderful way to teach the children how to pray the Rosary. This rosary can be prayed by itself, or included with the rosaries, chaplets or private prayers that we pray on a daily basis. This rosary devotion is very do-able on a daily basis, and we assure you that it will be Spiritually very beneficial for you and your family. Each person who joins will be assigned to a specific decade or mystery of the rosary. You will only pray one decade of the rosary every day, that is it. It is that simple!!! For example - let’s take the Joyful Mysteries, if you are assigned the first decade, you would pray the beginning prayers, The sign of the Cross, The Apostles Creed, The Our Father, The Three Hail Marys and The Glory Be. Then you would pray and meditate slowly on the 1st Joyful Mystery(The Annunciation) 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer (O’ My Jesus).  That is it, you are finished for the day. You pray this decade the same exact way every single day for 1 month. Then the 1st day of the 2nd month you switch to the 2nd Joyful Mystery (The Visitation ), pray 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory Be and O’ My Jesus. Pray this decade the same exact way every single day for the entire month. The 1st day of the 3rd month switch to the 3rd decade, pray this decade the same exact way every day for the entire month. The 1st day of the 4th month switch to the 4th decade, the 1st day of the 5th month switch to the 5th decade, and end with the Hail Holy Queen prayer, this completes the Rosary.  So by praying the Rosary in this fashion it will take you 5 months to pray one rosary this way and it will take you 20 months to pray all 4 Mysteries of the rosary. After completion of the 20 month schedule, you would start at the beginning again. That is why it is called The “Living Rosary”. It lives on and on and on. One of the beautiful parts about this devotion is the Meditations that are included with your schedule. Before you pray your assigned decade, you find the designated Meditation, read it and meditate on it while you are praying your decade. This way of praying empties and quiets our hearts from the ways of the world. We are drawn intimately into the lives of Our Lord and Our Lady, and receive the love, peace and joy from Them, that we can’t obtain from worldly things. We ask you to please pray for our Holy Father, all of our beloved Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and the religious throughout the entire world, for vocations, for all of the pro-life endeavors, and for all of the Spiritual and temporal needs of your own Parish. The beauty and power that makes this Rosary so special eminate from the hearts of the millions of people around the world who are also praying this devotion. They pray for all of your own personal heartfelt intentions, while you pray for theirs, so you are praying together in unity as one family. It is very, very powerful. Upon joining you will receive 3 sheets of information . The 1st sheet will be your 20 month schedule from top to bottom, and when you finish at the bottom of your schedule, you start over again at the top. (It is a life time commitment) The 2nd sheet is an explanation on how to pray this Living Rosary, along with the suggested intentions at the bottom, and the 3rd sheet front and back are all the meditations that go along with each individual decade that you pray. This “Living Rosary” began in Nazi occupied Poland during the second World War. Started in Krakow, Poland, as Nazis were arresting the Salesian Priests. The priests asked Catholic layman, Jan Tyranowski, to gather groups of 15 youth to pray the 15 decades (which are now 20). These groups were called Living Rosary Circles.  Pryaing for their freedom and families in war torn Europe, the Living Rosary brought peace and unity to those fleeing for their lives. From this 1st group of 15 youth, 10 became priests. One of these priests name was Fr. Karol Wojtyla, who is now our beloved St. Pope John Paul the II. This Living Rosary was a part of his path to the priesthood. He also prayed and promoted this Rosary his entire life.

        ' During World War II at a Lenten retreat in Poland, servant of God Jan Tyranowski a Catholic layman, was asked by Salesian Priests to organize Living Rosary groups since all priests were targeted by the Nazi regime. Groups were composed of fifteen devotees each meditating upon one of the fifteen mysteries daily. This ministry became a cornerstone for the Catholic underground in 1940. From these original devotions came ten men into the priesthood. At St. Stanislaus University in Krakow, Jan was the youth leader and central figure in the spiritual formation of the young Karol Wojtyla. Karol attended these meetings entitled the Living Rosary which fostered many vocations including Fr. Karol Wojtyla who in turn became Pope John Paul II.  In Mitchell South Dakota, US, in 2003, two priests from neighboring parishes asked their parishioners to start the Living Rosary for Lent. One of these priests Fr. Andrew being from Poland, was friends with Fr. Wojtyla. Father Andrew prayed the Living Rosary from his youth and instructed parishioners on how to pray the Living Rosary. In turn these parishioners’ numbers grew totaling five hundred devotees, thus began this Living Rosary in the US. The group asked others to help spread this beautiful devotion and rediscover the power of the Rosary. As of June 2019, this Living Rosary has spread to several states and countries in the world.'
