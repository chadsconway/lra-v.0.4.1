The Rosary will begin the 1st of each month. Each person who joins will be assigned to specific decades and mysteries which will be for 20 months, and with completion of the 20 months you will start over from the beginning, that’s why it’s called This Living Rosary it lives on. You will pray one (1) decade of the Rosary for the period of one (1) Month and on the first of the following month, you will go on to the following decade. You do not have to meet anyone, you pray individually anytime of the day at your own convenience.  While praying and meditating your assigned decade each day of every month Our Blessed Mother Mary is leading you slowly to Her Son Jesus.  Remember: When it is your turn to pray the First Decade of each Mystery of the Rosary, you will also have to say the prayers that begin the Rosary: The Apostles Creed, The Our Father, The three (3) Hail Marys’ The Glory Be to the Father, and The O, my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Likewise when it is your turn to pray the Fifth Decade of each Mystery of the Rosary, you will say the ending prayer: Hail, Holy Queen.  If, however, you forget to pray your decade of the Rosary on a day, please pray it twice the following day. This way you will have completed the Rosary which was not completed the day before.  Please include with your intentions, prayers for the spiritual and temporal needs of your parish, prayers for Pro-Life Intentions, prayers for Our Holy Father, all Bishops, Priests, Religious, and for the petitions of those who have joined the living Rosary Family.
