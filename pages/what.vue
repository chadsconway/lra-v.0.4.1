    "This Living Rosary embraces the hearts of thousands of families and
    individuals through the meditation on one decade daily, unifying their
    intentions with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, religious, parishes and
    pro-life endeavors. The devotion shows how the mysteries of Christ's life
    can be transformed into our daily lives, allowing the experience to live and
    love as Christ asks of us. Meditating with Jesus and Mary through these
    mysteries help us to discover the messages her son intends for our daily
    growth."
