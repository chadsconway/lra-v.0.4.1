      'The Living Rosary Apostolate is a devotion that has become a worlwide
      call to prayer. It is the Rosary in its entirety, but it is a shared
      devotion and accessible to all even in the busy schedule of our modern
      society. You do not need to meet with a group of people, you can pray
      individually as an adult or young person, anytime of the day or night at
      your own convenience.

      However if you desire, it can be prayed together as a husband and wife, or
      as a family with your children, or teachers with their student’s in our
      Catholic schools & CCD classes, it’s a wonderful way to teach the children
      how to pray the Rosary. This rosary can be prayed by itself, or included
      with the rosaries, chaplets or private prayers that we pray on a daily
      basis. This rosary devotion is very do-able on a daily basis, and we
      assure you that it will be Spiritually very beneficial for you and your
      family.

      Each person who joins will be assigned to a specific decade or mystery of
      the rosary. You will only pray one decade of the rosary every day, that is
      it. It is that simple!!! For example - let’s take the Joyful Mysteries, if
      you are assigned the first decade, you would pray the beginning prayers,
      The sign of the Cross, The Apostles Creed, The Our Father, The Three Hail
      Marys and The Glory Be. Then you would pray and meditate slowly on the 1st
      Joyful Mystery(The Annunciation) while praying 1 Our Father, 10 Hail
      Marys, Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer (O’ My Jesus). That is it, you are
      finished for the day.

    <v-card class="w3-margin w3-col l10" outlined>
      You pray this decade the same exact way every single day for 1 month. Then
      the 1st day of the 2nd month you switch to the 2nd Joyful Mystery (The
      Visitation ), pray 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory Be and O’ My Jesus.
      Pray this decade the same exact way every single day for the entire month.
      The 1st day of the 3rd month switch to the 3rd decade, pray this decade
      the same exact way every day for the entire month. The 1st day of the 4th
      month switch to the 4th decade, the 1st day of the 5th month switch to the
      5th decade, and end with the Hail Holy Queen prayer, this completes the
      Rosary.

      So by praying the Rosary in this fashion it will take you 5 months to pray
      one rosary this way and it will take you 20 months to pray all 4 Mysteries
      of the rosary. After completion of the 20 month schedule, you would start
      at the beginning again. That is why it is called The “Living Rosary”. It
      lives on and on and on. One of the beautiful parts about this devotion is
      the Meditations that are included with your schedule. Before you pray your
      assigned decade, you find the designated Meditation, read it and meditate
      on it while you are praying your decade. This way of praying empties and
      quiets our hearts from the ways of the world. We are drawn intimately into
      the lives of Our Lord and Our Lady, and receive the love, peace and joy
      from Them, that we can’t obtain from worldly things.

      This “Living Rosary” began in Nazi occupied Poland during the second World
      War. Started in Krakow, Poland, as Nazis were arresting the Salesian
      Priests. The priests asked Catholic layman, Jan Tyranowski, to gather
      groups of 15 youth to pray the 15 decades (which are now 20). These groups
      were called Living Rosary Circles. Pryaing for their freedom and families
      in war torn Europe, the Living Rosary brought peace and unity to those
      fleeing for their lives. From this 1st group of 15 youth, 10 became
      priests. One of these priests name was Fr. Karol Wojtyla, who is now our
      beloved St. Pope John Paul the II. This Living Rosary was a part of his
      path to the priesthood. He also prayed and promoted this Rosary his entire
      life.
