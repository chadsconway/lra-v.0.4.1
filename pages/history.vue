    ' During World War II at a Lenten retreat in Poland, servant of God Jan
    Tyranowski a Catholic layman, was asked by Salesian Priests to organize
    Living Rosary groups since all priests were targeted by the Nazi regime.
    Groups were composed of fifteen devotees each meditating upon one of the
    fifteen mysteries daily. This ministry became a cornerstone for the Catholic
    underground in 1940. From these original devotions came ten men into the
    priesthood. At St. Stanislaus University in Krakow, Jan was the youth leader
    and central figure in the spiritual formation of the young Karol Wojtyla.
    Karol attended these meetings entitled the Living Rosary which fostered many
    vocations including Fr. Karol Wojtyla who in turn became Pope John Paul II.
    In Mitchell South Dakota, US, in 2003, two priests from neighboring parishes
    asked their parishioners to start the Living Rosary for Lent. One of these
    priests Fr. Andrew being from Poland, was friends with Fr. Wojtyla. Father
    Andrew prayed the Living Rosary from his youth and instructed parishioners
    on how to pray the Living Rosary. In turn these parishionersâ€™ numbers grew
    totaling five hundred devotees, thus began this Living Rosary in the US. The
    group asked others to help spread this beautiful devotion and rediscover the
    power of the Rosary. As of June 2019, this Living Rosary has spread to
    several states and countries in the world.'
