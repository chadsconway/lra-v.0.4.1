							How to pray this Living Rosary
						</b-card-title>
						<b-card-text>
							This living rosary is the rosary in its entirety, but it is prayed
							in a different format or different way. You do not need to gather
							together with a group of people, you pray it individually at your
							convenience anytime of the day or night. However, if you desire,
							it can be prayed together as husband and wife, or as a family, mom
							and dad with their children, or in our catholic schools or
							religious education programs, the students by themselves or with
							their teachers. It is a wonderfu way to teach our children how to
							pray the rosary.
						</b-card-text>
						<b-card-text class="para">
							This rosary can be prayed by itself, or included with the
							rosaries, chaplets or private prayers that we pray on a daily
							basis. This rosary devotion is very do-able on a daily basis, and
							we assure you that it will be Spiritually very beneficial for
							families.
						</b-card-text>
						<b-card-text class="para">
							You will be assigned to a specific decade or mystery of the
							rosary. You will only pray one decade of the rosary every day,
							that is it. It is that simple!!! We will use the Joyful Mysteries
							as an example. If you are assigned the first joyful mystery you
							would start with the beginning prayer of the rosary, The sign of
							the Cross, The Apostles Creed, The Our Father, The Three Hail
							Marys and The Glory Be. Then you would pray 1 Our Father, 10 Hail
							Marys, Glory Be and the Fatima Prayer (O’ My Jesus). That is it,
							you are finished for the day.

							You pray this rosary the same way everyday for 1 month. The 1st
							day of the 2nd month you switch to the 2nd Joyful Mystery (The
							Visitation ), pray 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory Be and O’ My
							Jesus. Pray this decade the same exact way every single day for
							the entire month. The 1st day of the 3rd month switch to the 3rd
							decade, pray this decade the same exact way every day for the
							entire month. The 1st day of the 4th month switch to the 4th
							decade, the 1st day of the 5th month switch to the 5th decade, and
							end with the Hail Holy Queen prayer, this completes the Rosary.

							So by praying the Rosary in this fashion it will take you 5 months
							to pray one rosary this way, it will take you 20 months to pray
							all 4 Mysteries of the rosary. (Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful,
							Glorious). Then you just start from the beginning of your schedule
							again. That is why it is called this “Living Rosary”. It lives on
							and on and on. One of the beautiful parts about this devotion is
							the Meditations that are included with your schedule. Before you
							pray your assigned decade, you find the Meditation on your sheet,
							read it, focus on it while you are praying your decade. By doing
							so, this will draw you more intimately into the lives of our lord
							and our lady.

						<b-card-text class="para">
							We ask you to please pray for our Holy Father, all of our beloved

							own immediate Parish.

							This living rosary is not a new devotion. It started in krakow
							poland in 1940 during word war II. When the nazis arrested the
							Selecian priests, these priests turned to a catholic layman Yantow
							Wanowkski (Servant of God). They asked him to gather 15 youth to
							pray the 15 decades (which are now 20). These were called living
							rosary circles. and out of these first 15, 10 of them became
							priests. One of these priests we know very well today as our
							beloved Pope Saint John Paul II. He promoted this living rosary
							througout his entire life and wrote about it in several of his
							books and always taught it to his paritioners. He was often quoted
							saying the rosary was his favorite prayer.

							When we open our hearst to Jesus and Mary and let them in, that
							faith, hope, and love that we all long for, that the world longs
							for, it will flourish in our hearts and souls.
